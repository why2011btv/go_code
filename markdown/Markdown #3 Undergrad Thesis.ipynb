    "### a router is a Layer 3 network gateway device, meaning that it connects two or more networks and that the router operates at the network layer of the OSI model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Routers contain a processor (CPU), several kinds of digital memory, and input-output (I/O) interfaces. They function as special-purpose computers, one that does not require a keyboard or display.\n",
    "\n",
    "### By maintaining configuration information in a part of memory called the routing table, routers also can filter both incoming or outgoing traffic based on the addresses of senders and receivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home networks use Internet Protocol (IP) routers to connect computers to each other and to the Internet. Early generations of home routers supported wired networking with Ethernet cables while newer wireless routers supported Wi-Fi together with Ethernet. The term broadband router applies to any home wired or wireless router being used for sharing a broadband Internet connection.\n",

    "\n",
    "### A network switch is a small hardware device that centralizes communications among multiple connected devices in one local area network (LAN).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stand-alone Ethernet switch devices were commonly used on home networks many years before home broadband routers became popular. Modern home routers integrate Ethernet switches directly into the unit as one of their core functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-performance network switches are still widely used in corporate networks and data centers. Network switches are sometimes referred to as switching hubs, bridging hubs or MAC bridges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional network switches operate at Layer 2 Data Link Layer of the OSI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 与桥接器一样，交换机按每一个包中的MAC地址相对简单地决策信息转发。而这种转发决策一般不考虑包中隐藏的更深的其他信息。与桥接器不同的是交换机转发延迟很小，操作接近单个局域网性能，远远超过了普通桥接互联网网络之间的转发性能。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 交换机内部的CPU会在每个端口成功连接时，通过将MAC地址和端口对应，形成一张MAC表。在今后的通讯中，发往该MAC地址的数据包将仅送往其对应的端口，而不是所有的端口。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 交换机拥有一条很高带宽的背部总线和内部交换矩阵。交换机的所有的端口都挂接在这条背部总线上，控制电路收到数据包以后，处理端口会查找内存中的地址对照表以确定目的MAC（网卡的硬件地址）的NIC（网卡）挂接在哪个端口上，通过内部交换矩阵迅速将数据包传送到目的端口，目的MAC若不存在，广播到所有的端口，接收端口回应后交换机会“学习”新的MAC地址，并把它添加入内部MAC地址表中。\n",

    "### Equal-Cost Multi-path Routing，等价多路径。即存在多条到达同一个目的地址的相同开销的路径。当设备支持等价路由时，发往该目的 IP 或者目的网段的三层转发流量就可以通过不同的路径分担，实现网络的负载均衡，并在其中某些路径出现故障时，由其它路径代替完成转发处理，实现路由冗余备份功能。\n",

    "\n",
    "### 如果使用传统的路由技术，发往该目的地址的数据包只能利用其中的一条链路，其它链路处于备份状态或无效状态，并且在动态路由环境下相互的切换需要一定的时间，而等价多路径路由协议可以在该网络环境下同时使用多条链路，不仅增加了传输带宽，并且可以无时延无丢包地备份失效链路的数据传输。\n",

    "### 但想用好这个结构，需要solve a load balancing problem: distributing traffic across different paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 目前的ECMP：every switch will pick the next hop or pick the path for a packet by taking a hash of the packets' headers (which is a 5-tuple: source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's good about it is that it does this while preserving packet order. 比如：TCP could get confused by packet reordering and think it's a sign of congestion in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECMP的问题：1）hash collisions；2）it simply makes a purely local and stateless decision. The decision has nothing to do with the actual state of congestion in the network. ECMP can perform really poorly if the topology isn't perfectly symmetric. It is oblivious to congestion (作者做了一个比喻：San Francisco to San Jose两条路101, 280，ECMP通过抛硬币决定走哪条。当101路堵了，ECMP有50%的机率依然选择那条堵的。)\n",

    "### It's not enough to measure congestion on just the first hop (local congestion aware scheme at the switch is not enough). You need to be aware of the end-to-end path congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Every leaf switch (or top-of-rack switch) will track congestion metrics on a per path basis from themselves to every other leaf switch. And they will simply always try to send traffic on only the least congested path.\n",
    "\n",

    "### We are trying to track this per path congestion metric between the leaf switches. Every leaf switch maintain a table: Congestion-To-Leaf Table. The goal of the feedback mechanism is to populate metrics in this table. The metrics are 3-bit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### {Rate Measurement Module} measures link utilization (e.g., L0 -> S0, S0 -> L1, ...). The metric for a path is the maximum of congestion across all of its links. CE: Congestion Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback process: piggyback it on packets that are going in the reverse direction. So the switch L2 here will temporarily store the information and then anytime there is a packet going in the reverse direction it will pick the metric from L2 and carry it back to L0 and populate the \"congestion to leaf\" table at L0 which is the one that we set out to populate.\n",

    "### Per Flow. 这样控制粒度不够细化，flow的差异非常大；而Per Packet呢，粒度够细，但是要面对失序问题（reordering），跟TCP相关了。所以，Per Flowlet最好，不需要修改TCP，而且粒度也够细。\n",

    "### In packet switching networks, traffic flow, packet flow or network flow is a sequence of packets from a source computer to a destination, which may be another host, a multicast group, or a broadcast domain. RFC 2722 defines traffic flow as \"an artificial logical equivalent to a call or connection.\"[1] RFC 3697 defines traffic flow as \"a sequence of packets sent from a particular source to a particular unicast, anycast, or multicast destination that the source desires to label as a flow. A flow could consist of all packets in a specific transport connection or a media stream. However, a flow is not necessarily 1:1 mapped to a transport connection.\"[2] Flow is also defined in RFC 3917 as \"a set of IP packets passing an observation point in the network during a certain time interval.\"[3]\n",
